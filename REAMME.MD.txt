# Sudanese Arabic AI Dataset and Fine-tuning Project

## Goal
Build the first high-quality, open-source Sudanese Arabic dataset and fine-tune Arabic LLMs to support this rich and unique dialect.

## Why Sudanese Arabic?
Despite millions of native speakers, Sudanese Arabic remains underrepresented in NLP. Our project seeks to bridge this gap.

## How to Contribute
- Help annotate data
