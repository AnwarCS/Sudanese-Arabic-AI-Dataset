# Annotation Guidelines for Sudanese Arabic Project

## 1. Purpose

To ensure consistent, high-quality annotation of Sudanese Arabic text.

## 2. Key Points

- Identify pure Sudanese Arabic vs. Modern Standard Arabic.
- Note regional vocabulary where applicable (Khartoum, Darfur, East Sudan, North, South).
- Normalize spelling but respect Sudanese usage (e.g., شنُو؟ vs. ماذا؟).

## 3. Categories (Optional for later)

- Daily conversation
- Political speech
- Social media expressions
- Folk stories / proverbs
- Songs / poetry
