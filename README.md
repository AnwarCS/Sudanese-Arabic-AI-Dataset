# Sudanese Arabic LLM Project

**Towards Representation of Sudanese Arabic Dialect in Large Language Models**  
A collaborative initiative to build a high-quality dataset and fine-tune language models that understand and generate Sudanese Arabic.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

Sudanese Arabic is a widely spoken but underrepresented dialect in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project aims to:

- Collect and annotate Sudanese Arabic text from diverse sources.
- Create a balanced and labeled corpus.
- Fine-tune Arabic-supportive LLMs (e.g., AraBERT, CAMeL BERT, LLaMA).
- Evaluate model performance on dialect comprehension and generation.

## 📝 Annotation Guidelines (Summary)

**Goal:** Consistent and culturally-accurate annotation of Sudanese Arabic text.

### 1. Identify Language Variants:

- **Sudanese Arabic** vs. **Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)**.

### 2. Note Regional Vocabulary:

- Tag terms unique to **Khartoum, Darfur, East, North, South Sudan**.

### 3. Normalize Spelling:

- Respect Sudanese usage (e.g., `شنو؟` instead of `ماذا؟`).

### 4. (Optional) Categorize Content:

- Daily Conversations
- Political Speech
- Social Media Expressions
- Folk Stories / Proverbs
- Songs / Poetry
